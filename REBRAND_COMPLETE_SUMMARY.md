## ⚠️ SYNTAX ERROR FIXED

## 🚀 TO START THE SERVER

Your PowerShell execution policy is blocking npm. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Run as Administrator (Recommended)
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
3. Type `Y` to confirm
4. Navigate to: `cd "C:\Users\op\Desktop\magma src (1)\magma src"`
5. Run: `npm run dev`

### Option 2: Use the Batch File
1. Double-click `START_LOCAL_SERVER.bat` in the magma src folder
2. The server will start automatically

### Option 3: Use CMD Instead
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd)
2. Navigate to: `cd "C:\Users\op\Desktop\magma src (1)\magma src"`
3. Run: `npm run dev`

## 🌐 AFTER STARTING

The site will be available at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000

## 📦 NOT PUSHED TO GITHUB

As requested, all changes are LOCAL ONLY and have NOT been pushed to GitHub.

## 🔧 IF YOU SEE ERRORS

If you still see build errors after starting the server:
1. Clear the cache: Delete the `.next` folder
2. Restart the dev server
3. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)

The syntax error in layout.tsx has been fixed, so the site should build successfully now!
