# 🎨 Logo Sizing Optimized

## ❌ Original Issue
The Magma logo in the header was **too large** and overwhelming, making the header look unbalanced and taking up too much visual space.

## ✅ Logo Size Adjustments Applied

### Main Header Logo
**Before (Too Large):**
```jsx
className="h-8 sm:h-9 md:h-10 lg:h-11 w-auto"
```

**After (Optimized):**
```jsx
className="h-6 sm:h-7 md:h-8 lg:h-9 w-auto"
```

### Mobile Menu Logos
**Before:**
- Header logo: `h-11` (44px)
- Navigation logo: `h-10` (40px)

**After:**
- Header logo: `h-8` (32px) - 27% smaller
- Navigation logo: `h-7` (28px) - 30% smaller

## 📏 Size Comparison

| Screen Size | Before | After | Reduction |
|-------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Mobile** | 32px (h-8) | 24px (h-6) | 25% smaller |
| **Small** | 36px (h-9) | 28px (h-7) | 22% smaller |
| **Medium** | 40px (h-10) | 32px (h-8) | 20% smaller |
